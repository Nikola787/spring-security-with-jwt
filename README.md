# Spring Security with JWT
- Implemented secured APIs by making use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Includes three endpoints:
      /api/v1/demo-controller for testing access to the endpoint
      /api/v1/auth/register for registering new users
      /api/v1/auth/authenticate for authenticating existing users
- Followed specific diagram from the picture in order to implement the structure of the project.
